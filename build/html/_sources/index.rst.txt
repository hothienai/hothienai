Welcome to Embedded C Programming documentation!
=================================================

Hello and welcome to the Embedded C Programming documentation!

I'm Ai, a random embedded software engineer who loves to learn and share the good things. This documentation is used to document what I have learned about Embedded C programming, including basics of `C language`, `Embedded C concepts`, `State Machines`, and `Development Boards`. I hope that you find this resource helpful in your journey to mastering Embedded C programming. 

Thank you for visiting!
